        <br>
        <p>I wanted to design a phone stand, but it was rather hard as when looking for inspiration every and any design for a phone stand was out there already, so it was hard to do something new. 
            I knew I wanted to do something that was a little unqiue. I decided to create a phone stand that can be help in 2 different types of angles that the phone can stand on. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            I wanted to do the phone stand to be a whole unit, but I realised that it was going to take a very long time to print so i decided to split it up and use a bar to connect it together. 
            One problem I faced was the possibility that the model may not be able to withstand the weight of my phone. Since the model cannot be tested until it is printed, it was a gamble as to wether it will actually hold up. </p>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Originally, I wanted the phone stand to be printed as a whole. 
            However, I realised that it may not be the best choice as it take quite a lot of time and some areas may not be printed properly and with quality due to the nature of the model.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            So, I decided to break up the design to 2 different sections, the 2 side pieces as well as the bar that will be the connection. 
            This allowed for a shorter time for printing, less wastage and better printing quality.
