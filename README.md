            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! I am Natalin Sheng, a Year 3 student studying in Singapore Polytechnic as a Civil Engineering student. I have always been really fascinated and interested in the built environment as Singapore has a lot of buildings with great architecture. Outside of school, I really enjoy watching shows and movies, as well as hanging out with my family and friends.  </p>

            <h3>Week 3</h3>
            <p> To raster edit with gimp, i found a photo and used the 'free select' tool and highlighted the parts that I wanted to keep, it was quite hard to select as I was using my mouse, but I found that it was easier to draw rather than clicking, which produces really harsh lines. Then I used the 'select inverse' function and the 'clear' function to remove the background. It was quite hard to select as well since my was quite curly and it ptoduce a lot of harsh line due to the mouse control, I used the 'Smudge' tool to help smudge and smooth my outline so that it does not look too harsh. Lastly, I exported the image and saved it as a png. The GIMP software was quite easy to navigate and was very begineer friendly as it was very straightforward.</p>

             <p> I used InkScape to help with the logo making. I first started to make a logo, then I put it in the software and resize to fit the page. Then I used the 'Trace Bitmap' feature and 'Single Scan' function and adjusted the settings to make it as clear as possible. Initially I did not really think that there would be much difference, until I was done and saw eexactly how much of a difference there was. I was able to see how much clearer the retouched photo was. The lines were much more cleaner and not as pixelated when zoomed in. </p>

            <br>
            <p>I started by drawing the rectangle and then the using the 'Center Diameter Circle' function to draw the 2 circles at the top. Then I drew a 22.5 line from the center of the base and used the 'Center Retangle' function to draw the smaller rectangle. To finish off, I made sure to trim away all the sketch lines that were not needed. The software is quite straight forward, so I found it quite easy to navigate and use the software.  </p>

            <br>
            <p>I started off  excercise 4 by drawing the R30 circle and using the 'Inscribed Polygon' feature to do the 6-sided polygon with a radius of 20. Then I repeated the steps for the right side, with the circle being R20 and the polygon having 5 sides and a radius of 15. Then I connected the 2 circles together using the 'Center Rectangle' function. For the rounded ractangle, I used the 'Center Rectangle' function and added circles on each side and then trimming the unneccesary parts. </p>

            <h3>Week 4</h3>
            <p>This week we were tasked to complete multiple tasks such as moedlling a lego brick, nametag, as well as a mug. When I was trying out the lego brick, one key feature that stood out to me was the pattern feature. This feature allowed me to duplicate the lego studs in the way I wanted as well as helped to to save time as I did not have to do it one by one.</p>

                </video> 
            </center>
            <br>   
            <p>When I did the nametag, I learned that there was the 'text' feature which was something I never really thought that there was but it's something that was really helpful. I first started off by sketching a rectangle and adding the 2 circles to make the name tag hole, and then extracted it. Then I followed by using the 'shell' feature to shell out the part where I was going to put the text on, and then extracted that as well.  </p>
