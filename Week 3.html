        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <h3>Week 3</h3>
        <p> To raster edit with gimp, i found a photo and used the 'free select' tool and highlighted the parts that I wanted to keep, it was quite hard to select as I was using my mouse, but I found that it was easier to draw rather than clicking, which produces really harsh lines. Then I used the 'select inverse' function and the 'clear' function to remove the background. It was quite hard to select as well since my was quite curly and it ptoduce a lot of harsh line due to the mouse control, I used the 'Smudge' tool to help smudge and smooth my outline so that it does not look too harsh. Lastly, I exported the image and saved it as a png. The GIMP software was quite easy to navigate and was very begineer friendly as it was very straightforward.</p>

         <p> I used InkScape to help with the logo making. I first started to make a logo, then I put it in the software and resize to fit the page. Then I used the 'Trace Bitmap' feature and 'Single Scan' function and adjusted the settings to make it as clear as possible. Initially I did not really think that there would be much difference, until I was done and saw eexactly how much of a difference there was. I was able to see how much clearer the retouched photo was. The lines were much more cleaner and not as pixelated when zoomed in. </p>

        <p>I started by drawing the rectangle and then the using the 'Center Diameter Circle' function to draw the 2 circles at the top. Then I drew a 22.5 line from the center of the base and used the 'Center Retangle' function to draw the smaller rectangle. To finish off, I made sure to trim away all the sketch lines that were not needed. The software is quite straight forward, so I found it quite easy to navigate and use the software.  </p>

        <p>I started off  excercise 4 by drawing the R30 circle and using the 'Inscribed Polygon' feature to do the 6-sided polygon with a radius of 20. Then I repeated the steps for the right side, with the circle being R20 and the polygon having 5 sides and a radius of 15. Then I connected the 2 circles together using the 'Center Rectangle' function. For the rounded ractangle, I used the 'Center Rectangle' function and added circles on each side and then trimming the unneccesary parts. </p>
